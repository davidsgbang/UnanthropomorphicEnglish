Before getting started, you should ensure that your AWS credentials have been properly configured — this is crucial for avoiding frustrating permission issues down the line.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add davidsgbang/UnanthropomorphicEnglish
```

The [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) automatically detects and installs the skill for supported agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI).

```bash
npx skills use davidsgbang/UnanthropomorphicEnglish
```

If the environment lacks SKILL.md support, append `prompts/system-prompt.md` to your system prompt, `AGENTS.md`, or `.cursorrules`.

The skill loads automatically at the start of sessions at all times and applies unconditionally.

## No terminal? (claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini)

**Claude.ai** (paid plans) supports skills natively:

1. Download the skill file: open [SKILL.md](https://github.com/davidsgbang/UnanthropomorphicEnglish/raw/main/skills/unanthropomorphic-english/SKILL.md) and save it (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).
2. In claude.ai, go to **Settings → Capabilities** and turn on code execution.
3. Go to **Settings → Customize → Skills → Upload** and upload the saved `SKILL.md`.
4. Enable the skill. Claude loads it at the start of sessions at all times.

**ChatGPT**: no skill support, so use the prompt version. Copy the block from [`prompts/system-prompt.md`](prompts/system-prompt.md) into **Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions**, or into the instructions of a Project or Custom GPT.

**Gemini**: create a Gem and paste the same block into its instructions.

**Any other chatbot**: attach or paste `prompts/system-prompt.md` into the chat and say "apply this to everything you write for me".

## The rules

Key rules from the ASD-STE100 specification:

| Rule | What it kills |
|---|---|
| Max 20 words per instruction, 25 per description | The run-on sentence |
| One word = one meaning, whole document | check/verify/confirm/validate roulette |
| Simple tenses only | "has been updated" → "updated" |
| No "-ing" verb forms | ", making it easy to..." clauses |
| Active voice | "it should be noted that" |
| No should/would/may/might | Hedging. (`can`, `will`, `must` survive) |
| Condition BEFORE command | Trailing "...if the flag is set" that readers execute too late |
| One instruction per sentence | Steps nobody can follow at 2 a.m. |
| Keep articles, keep "that" | Telegraph style. STE is short, not terse |
| No first-person or self-references | "we updated" → "updated", "as an AI" |
| No conversational/polite filler | "hello", "please", "apologize", "sorry" |

Full paraphrased rules with software examples: [`SKILL.md`](skills/unanthropomorphic-english/SKILL.md).

## Not just docs

The skill ships adaptations ([`use-cases.md`](skills/unanthropomorphic-english/references/use-cases.md)) for:

- **Error messages**: what happened → why → what to do, in that order
- **Runbooks**: Imperative steps, conditions first, warnings before the step.
- **Incident reports**: simple past and third person ("the team reverted" instead of "we reverted")
- **Release notes**: breaking changes as warnings: command first, risk second
- **Your AGENTS.md / prompts**: a system prompt is a procedure. Models interpret "should" as optional; STE requires "must" or deletion.
- **Translation prep**: One meaning per word plus complete grammar removes most translation ambiguity.

Scope exclusion: marketing copy, blog voice, brand writing.

## Benchmarks

**81.5% fewer STE violations per 100 words with the skill on, averaged across 6 models × 8 writing tasks (96 generations, measured).**

| Model | Baseline viol/100w | Skill viol/100w | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude-opus-4-8 | 2.34 | 0.62 | 74% |
| claude-opus-4-7 | 2.81 | 0.41 | 85% |
| claude-opus-4-6 | 3.14 | 0.40 | 87% |
| claude-opus-4-5 | 2.94 | 0.71 | 76% |
| claude-sonnet-5 | 3.76 | 0.53 | 86% |
| claude-sonnet-4-6 | 2.65 | 0.51 | 81% |

Linter methodology, caveats, and full benchmark results are detailed in [`evals/results/RESULTS.md`](evals/results/RESULTS.md). Reproduce the benchmark using `python3 evals/run_bench.py` (requires Claude Code CLI).

## Receipts

Developed using test-driven methodology against the primary ASD-STE100 Issue 9 specification (2025):

- Baseline models without the skill wrote 40-word sentences and invented non-existent rules (e.g., citing "Rule 3.1: short sentences", whereas the actual Rule 3.1 governs verb forms).
- Verification of the official PDF confirms that "can" and "will" are approved modals, contrary to some secondary online sources.
- The skill is verified against the baseline test suite in [`evals/pressure-tests.md`](evals/pressure-tests.md).

## FAQ

**Does this guarantee STE certification?** No. ASD does not certify tools. The pragmatic mode applies structural rules with project-specific vocabulary. The strict mode aligns closely with the standard. The official standard is available at [asd-ste100.org](https://www.asd-ste100.org/request.html).

**Will the output sound robotic?** The output is flat, clear, and unambiguous. This matches the requirements of technical documentation.

**Why not prompt "write clearly"?** "Clearly" is subjective. Structural constraints like sentence length limits are objective specifications that models can follow.

**Why use ASD-STE100?** The standard is maintained (Issue 9, January 2025), structured, and testable. Its rules directly counter common verbose writing patterns.
